<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to messic Web Page.</h3>
                <p>
                    messic name comes from the union of two words:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Mess</strong>: A dirty or untidy state of things or of a place
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Music</strong>: Vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    The aim of the project is to convert this mess of music files in a real ordered and cataloged music library, playing it also in a comfortable way. The main characteristics are:
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Fully <strong>FREE</strong> and <strong>OPEN SOURCE</strong>! messic is totally free without any personal benefit. It has a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html" target="_blank">GPLv3 license</a>.

                        <li>
                            It order our catalog of music as automatic as possible, and it is owned only by you. You can go always to the file system where you are saving it and get it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It plays the music in a very comfortable and beautiful interface.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is executed via web, so we could publish this service at home for every device.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            It is multiuser.

                        <li>
                            It is focused to catalog your personal music library. We want to manage and listen to our own catalog of music at home without uploading anything to the internet.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            You don't need to be connected to the internet to listen to your music. It is available always in your home network, or downloaded locally to your device.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>
<a id="detail" name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>I don't understand it well. What is messic and How it works?</h3>

                <p>If you really love music then you probably want to collect and save it in a safe, ordered and accessible way. Let's suppose that you also think that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>those music cloud services (like spotify) don't offer to you all the music catalog that you would like, or it is not complete,</li>
                    <li>or it is not well organized in some cases,</li>
                    <li>or simply you don't believe in a service that can be down in the future,</li>
                    <li>or you prefer to be the owner of the music you pay and don't get only the right to hire music for a period of time,</li>
                    <li>something that can't even inherit your children...</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If that's the case, then <strong> messic is made for you</strong >.</ p>

        <p>You just need to download the messic service for the platform you wish (windows, mac or linux) and install it in any device in your home.  Once installed, you could start and stop the service.  This service will provide to you a web access to the <strong>web interface of messic</strong>, namely, from that pc, laptop or any other device (even from your Android and IOS devices) you could see the messic web interface just opening it from any modern navigator and launching the URL of the device where messic was installed (probably something similar to http://192.168.1.X:8080/messic. This URL will depend on the equipment where you installed the messic service in your local network...<strong>Don't worry, the messic service will let you know how is that URL when you start it</strong>).</p>

                <p>Therefore, you have installed the messic service at any PC of your home network and now, from this device, or any other, you are ready to access to the messic web interface to manage your music. Let's start uploading some music to messic: you select the audio files that you want to attach for the album that you are creating and any other resource like covers, arts, lyrics, and so on... You can add all the extra information of your music, like the year of publishment, author, observations, genre, song names, ... or add this information obtaining it from the mp3 tags automatically, or thanks to external services like freedb or discogs, which are also supported by messic. For sure you can use this web interface to listen to your music whenever you wish, or even enable the DLNA protocol to share your music with other devices in your home.</p>

                <p>All that music you are uploading is being sotred in an ordered way into the folder that you chosen during the messic installation, so you can access it directly without the messic service, <strong>making it possible to continue enyoing your ordered music without any messic dependency</strong>, in case you don't want to continue using messic in the future. Moreover, if the messic service is installed in your home, in your network, and you don't want to publish it against the internet, then you probably will want to use the Android smartphone client. This Android client can connect with your messic service and listen to your music from there, or you can as well download your music to your device in order to listen to your music everywhere, <strong>without the need to be connected to your messic service.</strong></p>

                </span></a>News! Android client version</h3>

                <p>We have now a new native Android client for messic. Thanks to this client you will connect with your mobile device easily to your messic server. You will play from the device all your music at the server and also you can download your preferred music to your device, allowing playing it in an offline mode.</p>
                <p>You can download the app from your preferred play store (see right links), or if you prefer, you can download directly the APK and install it manually:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>From your mobile device, go to Settings, scroll down to Security, and select Unknown sources.</li>
                    <li>Download <a href="https://github.com/spheras/messic-android/releases/download/v1.0.2/messic-client-android_v1.0.2_signed.apk" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://github.com/spheras/messic-android/releases/download/v1.0.2/messic-client-android_v1.0.2_signed.apk'); return false;">the APK file</a> from your mobile (or copy to your mobile).</li>
                    <li>Once your APK is in your mobile device you only need to search for it (maybe you need some kind of file explorer to find it, or it is at the download section).</li>
                    <li>Install the app.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>
<a name="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Last inestable version</h3>

                <p>Our recomendation is to download only the last stable version, but if you live on the edge and need to have the last last version of messic, you can download it from github directly. By the moment, you will need to compile it, but soon we will built night builds and so on.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Which navigators are compatible?</h4> Essentially all those compatible with html5 and css3, but that's not true. Please update your navigator to the last version and probably you will not have any problems.
                        <br>
                        <br>If you are trying to launch messic from a Microsoft Internet Explorer... well, good luck (really it seems that with version 11 is more or less ok). We have tested with google chrome (some versions of chromium for linux seems to have problems playing mp3 files natively), firefox, safari (from 6.1 version). Konqueror doesn't seems to be ok :(
                        <br>You can see at the <a href="https://github.com/spheras/messic/wiki/Navigator-Compatibility-Table" target="_blank">wiki pages</a> a table with the user's results launching messic in different navigators. Any help filling this table with real information is more than welcome.
                        <br>
                        <br>We are working to improve compatibility, but <strong>please, please, update your navigator always you can</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Can I share messic music through DLNA protocol with other devices?</h4> Yes!, you can. You need to activate DLNA share content at the settings page of messic. There are two parts that need to be checked. The first one is the general setting to allow DLNA. This is done only by the administrator, at the administrator settings. If this is abled, then each user can allow at the music settings if they want to share their content over DLNA or not.
                        <br>
                        <br>Please, take into account that DLNA protocol doesn't have any authoring mechanisms, so, if you allow DLNA sharing content, any devices at home could get info from messic. This shouldn't be a problem if you have a controlled network, but keep in mind.
                        <br>We have tested connecting some DLNA devices to messic, but there are a lot of variety at the market. We are working constructing a table with the information given by the users. <a href="https://github.com/spheras/messic/wiki/DLNA-Compatibility-Table" target="_blank">Consult it to see if your device has been tested</a>. Any information about compatibility is more than welcome.

                    <li>
                        <h4>Does messic use a secure protocol SSL/TLS?</h4> Initially no, because it's intended to be in your home, inside your home network. But if you need, you can do it by modifying the configuration.
                        <br>
                        <br>Just open the messic monitor and open the configuration section. From there you can modify a set of options, and also to enable the security (also you can specify the https port).
                        <br>
                        <br>After a restart of the messic service, the connections will be done through the new https port, and probably your navigator will advise you because the messic certificate doesn't correspond to the url, and so on. This is normal, but if you want also to fix it, you only need to go to the folder [messic_folder]/jetty/etc/ and you will find there all the jetty configuration. Just touch the jetty-selector-ssl.xml file with your own configuration.
                        <br>Another important question is the imposibility to share content over DLNA when the security is activated. This is really due to the problem of the certificate validation.

                        <h4>How can I help the project?</h4> We need a lot of help. For example, translations of messic to other languages. At this time, we have not defined a protocol for external helps, but we will do. For us is very useful if you notify and describe us the bugs you find on messic. It helps a lot to improve the application. Also you can tell us your desired improvements for next versions.
                        <br>
                        <br>We really need a lot of help, like graphical designers, programmers, and so on... maybe, if you want to work seriously with us, the best way could be forking the project and pull request. You have a guide <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        <h4>Can I use messic for free?</h4> Yes, its free in both senses. It has a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html" target="_blank">GPLv3 license</a>.

                        <h4>I want to move my music folder to other place. How can I do?</h4> OK, it's very easy. All the necessary information is inside your folder (included database). So you just need to stop messic service, move the WHOLE folder (which is configured at the messic monitor). After that, open the messic monitor and update the new location in the configure section. Finally, you can launch the messic service with this new location.

                        <h4>I don't see well some pages of messic. What can I do?</h4> Well, in the most of cases, you should upgrade your navigator. In the case you use Internet Explorer, well... it's better to change. Give an opportunity to other navigators like <a href="https://www.mozilla.org" target="_blank">firefox</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/" target="_blank">chrome</a>.

                        <h4>Can I see messic from my mobile phone or tablet?</h4> News!: You can download now a native application for Android!!. More information <a href="#android">here</a>. In general you can connect to the web page by a mobile navigator. We have tested some cases and usually it works, not perfectly, but works. The best is to try and tell us your experience. We are working in this area, and also thinking to build native applications.</a>.
