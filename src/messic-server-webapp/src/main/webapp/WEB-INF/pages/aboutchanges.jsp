	            		<li><h4>Messic Radio:</h4>We added a plugin to allow cast your music to an icecast2 radio.  By the moment this only works on Linux, and you need to install an icecast2 server to connect with.</li>
	            		<li><h4>Drag&Drop Queue:</h4>Now you can move the current queue playlist elements to a different position. Just drag and drop to the new position</li>
