MESSIC
======

Messic comes from the union of two words:
  - **Mess**: _A dirty or untidy state of things or of a place_
  - **Music**: _Vocal or instrumental sounds (or both) combined in such a way as to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion_

The aim of this project is to convert this mess of music into an ordered catalog of music and play it in a confortable way. The main characteristics will be:

* It sorts your library of music as automatically as possible.
* It gives you absolute control of your music. You can always go to the file system and do whatever you want with your music.
* It plays your music in a very very confortable and beautiful interface.
* It is executed via web, so you could run this service at home for every device.
* It is multiuser.
* It is focused on managing your home catalog of music. We want to manage and listen to our own catalog of music.
